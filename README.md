## Walk-Through Video




## Description

This assignment was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. We were required to create testing in our code. 

## Installation

To run the tests, you have to run an integrated terminal and install npm. To run the generator, you run an integrated terminal and answer the questions. Once you select "finish", an index.html is added to the dist folder. When you open it in your browser you will see a site with cards and the team's information displayed on them.

## Usage

This is a great use for companies to keep track of employee personal contact information. You can see the role of the team member and their information clearly and add more members in a simple, efficient way.
